# FA-18c hornet DDI.
Physical representataion of the buttons around the digital display indicator (DDI) for the FA-18c, to be used in flight simulation games. Note that many McDonnell Douglas airplanes around that time use a similar unit. F-16, F-15, the US version of the Harrier.  
  
The project invoves a custom made PCB, made in Ki-Cad. It's powered by an Arduino pro micro, which uses an Atmel Atmega32u4. It's main strength it the usb controller inside the chip. It will act as a windows joystick device, with 20 buttons that can be mappend in the game to the DDI/MFD.
